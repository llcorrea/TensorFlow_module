# Machine Learning model with TensorFlow2

Machine Learning (ML) models using TensorFlow (TF) libs.

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Its APIs are organized hierarchically, with the high-level APIs built on the low-level APIs.

Low-level APIs are used to explore new ML algorithms. On the contrary, the high-level API named tf.keras is used to train and define machine learning models. 

In this implementation, the API and functions of tf.keras are explored.

TF documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/

This code was implemented following the course [*Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs*](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) provided by [Google AI](https://ai.google/education/).
